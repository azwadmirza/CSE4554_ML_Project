# CSE4554_ML_Project


This is a project that involves bug detection using machine learning for python machine learning based code.

The dataset was obtained from the following [url](https://pytracebugs-dataset.obs.ap-southeast-3.myhuaweicloud.com/pytracebugs_dataset_v1.rar)

The following paper was used to guide us through the process: [PyTraceBugs: A Large Python Code Dataset for Supervised Machine Learning in Software Defect Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9712116)

DOI for paper: 10.1109/APSEC53868.2021.00022
